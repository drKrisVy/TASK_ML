# TASK_ML

## Task 1: CampusPulse – Student Data Exploration & Prediction

### Objective:
To explore anonymized student data and build a model to predict the likelihood of a student being in a romantic relationship based on lifestyle and academic patterns.

### Approach:
- **Level 1 – Variable Identification**: Used EDA tools like correlation heatmaps and distribution plots to guess the identity of anonymized features.
- **Level 2 – Data Cleaning**: Detected missing values and outliers. Applied context-based imputation strategies.
- **Level 3 – Insight Generation**: Framed 5+ analytical questions, supported by meaningful visualizations and interpretations.
- **Level 4 – Classification Models**: Built models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict relationship status. Evaluated with accuracy, F1-score, etc.
- **Level 5 – Model Explainability**: Used SHAP to interpret feature importance and local explanations. Visualized decision boundaries.

Task 2: Building an AI Assistant

### Objective:
To build a goal-driven, tool-using AI agent using LangGraph and LLMs, capable of context-aware responses.

### Approach:
- **Level 1 – Core Setup**: Created a LangGraph node with an LLM-based chatbot and integrated a calculator tool.
- **Level 2 – External Sensing**: Added tools for fetching weather data and fashion trends.
- **Level 3 – Intent Routing & Memory**: Implemented logic for routing based on user intent and added conversational memory support.
- **Level 4 – Multi-Agent System**: Designed and coordinated multiple agents (e.g., researcher, decision-maker) with extended toolsets.
